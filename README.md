# introduce-yourself-assignment
Our first school activity website was essentially a brief introduction about ourselves, created using HTML. And I think I cooked well on this assignment.  üë®‚Äçüç≥

The things you may see on the featured projects may be real or not; it depends on whether you want to believe that information, as I'm not revealing whether I actually got featured there or not. :p

PS: I borrowed the CSS code for the shake animation, which I found on this website(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shake_image.asp). Many thanks to the W3Schools team for providing such a helpful asset :DDDD
